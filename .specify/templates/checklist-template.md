# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

Purpose: [Brief description of what this checklist covers]  
Created: [DATE]  
Feature Spec: [Link to feature spec.md]  
Overview Spec: [Link to overview spec.md, if relevant]  
Issue(s): [#123, #124]  

Note: This checklist is generated by `/speckit.checklist` based on feature context
(spec, plan, tasks) and the Engineering Constitution.

---

## 1. Specification Consistency

- `[ ] CHK-S-001: Feature spec references the correct Overview spec for shared masters/APIs`
- `[ ] CHK-S-002: Feature spec does not redefine shared masters or APIs; it only references IDs`
- `[ ] CHK-S-003: All relevant user stories (UC-...) are clearly defined and independently testable`
- `[ ] CHK-S-004: Business rules and validation rules are documented and unambiguous`
- `[ ] CHK-S-005: Non-functional requirements are captured where applicable`
- `[ ] CHK-S-006: Functional requirements (FR-xxx), success criteria (SC-xxx), and edge cases are documented`

---

## 2. Plan Quality

- `[ ] CHK-P-001: Plan clearly maps spec user stories to technical components`
- `[ ] CHK-P-002: Data and schema changes are documented, including migration strategy`
- `[ ] CHK-P-003: API changes (new or modified) are listed and map to spec contracts`
- `[ ] CHK-P-004: Test strategy covers unit, integration, and E2E where appropriate`
- `[ ] CHK-P-005: Plan includes a rollback and deployment strategy`

---

## 3. Tasks Coverage

- `[ ] CHK-T-001: All user stories (UC-...) have corresponding tasks`
- `[ ] CHK-T-002: Tasks are small, concrete, and independently reviewable`
- `[ ] CHK-T-003: There are explicit tasks for tests (not just implementation)`
- `[ ] CHK-T-004: There are tasks for updating documentation and agent files when needed`
- `[ ] CHK-T-005: Tasks exist for updating the Overview spec and dependent Feature specs if shared masters/APIs change`
- `[ ] CHK-T-006: Tasks reference relevant Spec/UC IDs and primary file paths to reduce ambiguity`

---

## 4. Git and PR Workflow

- `[ ] CHK-G-001: Work is on an Issue-linked branch (feature/<issue>-... or spec/<issue>-...)`
- `[ ] CHK-G-002: PR will reference Issue(s) and Spec ID(s) in its description`
- `[ ] CHK-G-003: Direct pushes to main are not used for this change`
- `[ ] CHK-G-004: Branch will be deleted after PR merge (or there is a documented reason not to)`
- `[ ] CHK-G-005: GitHub CLI (gh) is available and used where automation is expected`

---

## 5. Test Integrity

- `[ ] CHK-TEST-001: Tests are derived from the spec's user stories and acceptance criteria`
- `[ ] CHK-TEST-002: Team confirms that tests will fail if the feature is missing or broken`
- `[ ] CHK-TEST-003: There is no intention to weaken or remove tests solely to pass CI`
- `[ ] CHK-TEST-004: There is an explicit plan to diagnose failures (spec vs tests vs implementation vs environment)`
- `[ ] CHK-TEST-005: Any changes to tests are documented with reasoning`

---

## 6. AI Agent Conduct

- `[ ] CHK-AI-001: AI agents are given clear context (Overview spec, Feature spec, plan, tasks)`
- `[ ] CHK-AI-002: AI agents are not asked to bypass spec, tests, or Git rules`
- `[ ] CHK-AI-003: AI-generated changes are kept small and reviewable`
- `[ ] CHK-AI-004: Ambiguities or conflicts are escalated via Issues, not silently guessed`

---

## 7. Notes

- Use `[x]` to mark completed items.
- Add comments inline when an item is partially satisfied or intentionally skipped.
- Use this checklist as a review tool at key milestones (before coding, before PR, before deploy).
